# CloudLedger

CloudLedger is an Android-first accounting app built with Rust and Tauri. The
first implementation targets personal private ledgers plus company public
ledgers with cloud sync, role-based authorization, approval states, soft
deletes, and audit trails.

## Development

```bash
nix develop
pnpm install
cargo test --workspace
pnpm build
```

Useful commands are wrapped in `justfile`:

```bash
just check
just tauri-dev
just android-build
```

The Android target is built through Tauri v2:

```bash
pnpm tauri android build
```
